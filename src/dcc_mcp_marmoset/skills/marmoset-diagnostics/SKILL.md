# Marmoset Toolbag Diagnostics

Inspect before changing preferences or releasing resources. Missing texture
reports contain local paths and are intended for the current workstation only.
`inspect_runtime` reports the tooltip database directory and file count.
`set_display_tooltips` changes a persistent Toolbag preference, but does not
repair or silence a missing-database startup error; report that host packaging
defect separately.

If a Core job remains pending while Toolbag is unfocused, activate that exact
instance through native DCC UI Control, then poll the existing job. Do not retry
the mutation and do not launch another Toolbag process.
