# Marmoset Toolbag Scene

Inspect the scene before mutating it. File tools require absolute paths and do
not create missing parent folders. Treat render calls as monolithic Toolbag
operations: poll the returned Core job and do not retry after a transport
timeout until the output path and job status have been checked.
