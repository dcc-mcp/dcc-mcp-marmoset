# Marmoset Toolbag Lookdev

Inspect material bindings first. Frame by exact object UID when preparing a
hero asset; omit the UID only when the full scene should determine the camera.

`configure_color_output` can select Toolbag's ACES tone mapper for visual
comparison. Toolbag does not expose an OCIO/ACEScg transform API, so this is
an output-boundary check rather than an OCIO-managed production workflow.
